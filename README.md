# Ragnarok-Boss-Timer
This is a Web app I created independently that is designed to help keep track of MVP (AKA bosses) spawn timers in Ragnarok Online. Each MVP in the game has a its own timer, which have audio alarms that are played a few minuts before the MVP's respawn is getting close.

I'm likely going to scrap the project and get a fresh start at some point. I'm not happy with the coding style used, especially in the JavaScript.
